OBSTACLES
------------------------------------------

I had to figure out a way to accomodate both single digit and double digit votes.

A consistent thing to keep in mind was to not let my program go out of bounds.

Another part of the program which I needed to work on was to know which type of data I was expecting when checking correct syntax. I solved this by switching a tester variable.

DESIGN
------------------------------------------

hasCorrectSyntax(pollData)
    loop through string and test each chunk, data type of chunk is indicated by tester variable which is initially set to state
        if tester is state
            if chunk is invalid
                break and return false
        else if tester is votes
            check for single or double digits
            if digit isnt found
                break and return false
        else if tester is party
            if current char is not alpha
                break and return false
        
countVotes(pollData, party)
    if !hasCorrectSyntax(pollData)
        break and return false
    if party is not alpha
        break and return false

    loop through polldata, only checking digits
        if digit is found
            find out if votes is single digit or double digit
            if party is same as desired
                add it tempvote to voteCount
